# Blockchain Integration Notes

This document outlines the implementation of wallet connection, network detection, and transaction feedback for the technical test task.

## Wallet Connection & Network Detection

We use **MetaMask** as the wallet provider and `ethers.js` to handle blockchain interactions.

The main logic is implemented in `WalletConnect.js`, which:

- Connects to the user's wallet using `eth_requestAccounts`.
- Retrieves the connected address and network name using `ethers.providers.Web3Provider`.
- Listens for:
  - `accountsChanged` ‚Üí triggers reconnection.
  - `chainChanged` ‚Üí reloads the page to stay in sync.
- Displays the connected address and network in the UI.
- Includes a "Disconnect" button that clears local state (note: MetaMask cannot be fully disconnected programmatically from frontend logic).

### Example

```js
if (window.ethereum) {
  window.ethereum.on('accountsChanged', () => connectWallet());
  window.ethereum.on('chainChanged', () => window.location.reload());
}
UI Feedback: Transaction Lifecycle
The TransactionSimulator.js component performs a simple simulation by sending ETH from the connected account to itself. It shows real-time feedback throughout the transaction lifecycle:

üîÑ Sending transaction...

‚è≥ Waiting for confirmation...

‚úÖ Transaction completed!

‚ùå Error if the transaction fails

It uses the signer.sendTransaction method from ethers.js and waits for confirmation using tx.wait().

Core Logic
js
Copiar
Editar
const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({
  to: await signer.getAddress(),
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.00001"),
});
await tx.wait();
setStatus("‚úÖ Transaction completed!");
Component Integration Strategy
To avoid duplicate connection buttons and ensure a clean state flow between components:

Navbar.jsx holds the shared state: provider and signer.

WalletConnect receives a prop onWalletConnected and updates the parent with the connected provider and signer.

TransactionSimulator receives the signer as a prop and disables the "Simulate Tx" button if no wallet is connected.

This architecture ensures clean separation of concerns and smooth communication between components.

How to Test
Run the project using:

bash
Copiar
Editar
npm start
Click Connect Wallet to connect MetaMask.

Confirm that the address and network are displayed.

Click Simulate Tx to perform a test transaction and follow the feedback status.

Notes
We use ethers.js v5.x (already included in the project).

No additional dependencies were installed.

Styles are fully compatible with Bootstrap.

The UI is responsive and consistent with the original project design.
